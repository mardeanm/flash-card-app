A program to help with studying of languages
by showing a flash card ui

Clicking the Check button means you know the word, and it will remove it from
the list of words to learn

Clicking no will bring up a new word

After 3 seconds the card will show the english meaning of the word

It reads from a frequency list of words in a csv file
which can be changed by changing LANG_LIST by changing the path to a different
file of your choosing

You can make your own custom list of words to learn in google sheets using this method:

The program requires the non-english language to be in the first column and the english words to be in the second
LANG would also need to be changed appropriately
